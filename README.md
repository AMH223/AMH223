- 👋 Hi, I’m @AMH223
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code
I really liked using Termux once in awhile but 
I see that trying to install the packages isn't easy anymore. I tried to learn from Termux but I really only learned how to install pkgs and that was it. 🤷‍♀️
- 🌱 I’m currently learning...I truly do want to learn to code . I would like to learn. I'm also curious as to why the Termux pkgs won't install on my device and 
whether or not there is a way to install them again. I was reading about ot a little bit but I didn't really find a solution. If this doesn't make any sense to you guys I'm going to be embarrassed. 
I get intimidated by people who can do the things that some of you can do. Although, I actually took a computer programming class in high school (Did I mention I was in high school at the age 
of 5?) We had these computer csrds and We had to colour in these little squares using pencil, and then "feed"them into this big ass machine! You colour in the wrong square and the whole thing was off! I remember having to go through all these cards to find the error.... I hated that class. Btw I can't remember the name of that computer system or the machine! I'm sure someone here might remember the name. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet, unless you want me to check spelling etc. I would be so happy to do anything to help. 
- 📫 How to reach me? You can reach me by email, higgins.annemarie@yahoo.com I'd love to be able to ask a question about Linux or the different terminal emulators and not feel so um, stupid? That is kind of what interests me still. Well that's all about me for now.
If you have anymore questions just ask. 😁 🙃 🇨🇦 <------- I'm from Ontario, Canada as well.
